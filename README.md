**Potato Disease Classification**

Potato Disease Classification is a smart web and mobile application designed to assist farmers in diagnosing potato plant diseases through leaf image analysis. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system can accurately detect and classify common potato leaf diseases, helping farmers take timely and informed actions to protect their crops.

**How It Works:**
Users can simply upload an image of a potato leaf through the app or website. The image is then processed using a trained deep learning model built with TensorFlow, which classifies the disease and provides insights on the identified issue.

**Key Features:**

🌿 AI-Based Detection: Uses CNN models for accurate image classification of potato leaf diseases.

⚙️ Backend Efficiency: Powered by FastAPI, enabling high-speed inference and scalability.

💻 Interactive Frontend: Built with React.js, offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface for farmers and researchers.

📱 Cross-Platform Accessibility: Available as both a web and mobile application for maximum reach.

🌐 Real-World Impact: Aims to support farmers in early detection, improving crop yield and reducing losses caused by late intervention.
